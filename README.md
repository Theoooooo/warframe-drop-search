# Warframe Drop Search

I created this website to be able to search through the drop table that is being exposed through the [Warframe Drop Table Website](https://warframe-web-assets.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/uploads/cms/hnfvc0o3jnfvc873njb03enrf56.html#phoridassassination)

I was a bit tired to not being able to quickly find drop through mission and drop tables in an efficient way, so i made myself a website drafted from IA in the beginning to gain some time, and then modify the content to be able to suit my use

It's rough, it may be laggy for the first search and the final result isn't finalised yet, but it's a working website ðŸ™‚

The data.json file contains the datas being loaded inside the website, no data refresh is configured yet (no time right now) but a daily refresh will be setuped through pipelines

There's currently a filter that blacklist certain categories from the drop table website to prevent empty dataset and non-working parsing because some of the tables are formed differentely inside the website :
- "Disclaimer:"
